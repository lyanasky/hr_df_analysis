# Predicting Employee Attrition: A Data Analytics Approach

Objective:
The objective of this capstone was to use data analytics to develop accurate models for predicting employee attrition in a consulting firm. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset, our aim was to provide valuable insights to the HR department and optimize retention strategies.

Methodology:
We followed a systematic data analytics approach. We conducted exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset, cleaned and preprocessed the data, and used feature engineering techniques to extract meaningful insights. We then selected regression or machine learning models, evaluated their performance using metrics like accuracy and precision, and optimized them to avoid overfitting.

Key Findings:
Our analysis provided valuable insights for HR strategy. The predictive models demonstrated high accuracy in forecasting attrition. Factors like job satisfaction, work-life balance, compensation, and performance ratings were identified as key contributors to attrition. Addressing these factors can improve employee retention.

Deliverables:
We produced a one-page summary highlighting the project's objectives, methodology, and key findings. We also developed a comprehensive code notebook containing the implementation of the project, including data cleaning, preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation.

Conclusion:
This capstone project successfully predicted employee attrition in a consulting firm using data analytics. The findings empower the HR department to make informed decisions and implement effective retention strategies. The one-page summary and code notebook serve as valuable references for future analysis. The models developed have the potential to enhance the organization's ability to manage attrition and optimize employee retention efforts.
